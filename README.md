# MCP Template

A template repository providing a barebones foundation for building Model Control Protocol (MCP) servers for macOS applications and command line tools.

## Overview

MCP Template serves as a starting point for developers looking to implement MCP servers in their projects. This template demonstrates how to use the `mcp-swift-sdk` in a minimal way, making it easier to understand the basics of MCP integration. It includes both a library template for integration into other projects and a simple command-line example to illustrate basic usage.

## Purpose

This repository is intended to be:
- A reference implementation showing how to use `mcp-swift-sdk`
- A template that can be forked or cloned as a foundation for your own MCP server implementations
- A barebones example that demonstrates core MCP concepts with minimal code

## Features

Current and planned features include:

- [x] Basic Swift package structure
- [x] Command line "hello world" example tool
- [x] Command line stdio for direct MCP interaction via the `run` command
- [ ] App Store safe command line stdio ‚Üí standalone Mac app communication
- [ ] SSE server in a Package ‚Üí example command line app for SSE-based MCP

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add the following to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/your-username/mcp-template.git", branch: "main"),
]
```

Then add the dependency to your target:

```swift
.target(
    name: "YourTarget",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "EasyMCP", package: "mcp-template")
    ]
),
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

```swift
import EasyMCP

// Create an instance of EasyMCP
let mcp = EasyMCP()

// Register a tool
try await mcp.register(tool: Tool(
    name: "helloPerson",
    description: "Returns a friendly greeting message",
    inputSchema: [
        "type": "object",
        "properties": [
            "name": [
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Name of the person to say hello to",
            ]
        ],
        "required": ["name"]
    ]
)) { input in
    // It's an async closure, so you can await whatever you need to for long running tasks
    await someOtherAsyncStuffIfYouWant()
    // Return your result and flag if it is/not an error
    return Result(content: [.text(hello(input["name"]?.stringValue ?? "world"))], isError: false)
}

// Start the MCP server for full MCP interaction
try await mcp.start()
try await mcp.waitUntilComplete()
```

### Command Line Example

The package includes a command line executable called `mcpexample` that demonstrates basic usage:

```bash
# Run the basic hello example
mcpexample hello

# Start the MCP server to handle MCP protocol communications
mcpexample run
```

## Project Structure

### Targets

1. **EasyMCP** (Library)
   - Minimal template implementation of an MCP server
   - Demonstrates basic integration with the MCP protocol
   - Shows how to leverage the official `mcp-swift-sdk`
   - Includes a simple tool example (helloworld)

2. **mcpexample** (Executable)
   - Simple command-line example using the EasyMCP library
   - Includes both a hello command and a run command
   - The run command starts a full MCP server using stdio transport
   - Uses `ArgumentParser` for CLI argument handling

3. **EasyMCPTests** (Test Target)
   - Template tests for the EasyMCP library functionality
   - Includes a basic test for the hello function

### Dependencies

- [swift-argument-parser](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser) (1.3.0+) - Used for CLI argument handling
- [mcp-swift-sdk](https://github.com/adamwulf/mcp-swift-sdk) (branch: "feature/wait-for-complete") - Custom fork of the MCP implementation that adds the ability to wait for the mcp server to finish

## Development

To use this template for your own MCP server:

1. Clone or fork the repository
2. Build the package to verify everything works:
   ```bash
   swift build
   ```
3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   swift test
   ```
4. Modify the EasyMCP implementation to add your custom functionality
5. Extend the command line example or create your own Mac application

It may also be helpful to use [the MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) to diagnose and debug a custom MCP server.

``` bash
$ npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

## Testing your MCP command line executable

To test and debug your MCP server using the MCP Inspector:

1. Build your command line executable in Xcode
2. Locate the executable by going to Xcode ‚Üí Product ‚Üí Show Build Folder in Finder
3. Copy the absolute path of the executable from that directory
4. Use the [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) to test your server
5. Open Terminal and run:
   ```bash
   npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector <absolute_path_to_your_executable> run
   ```
6. Open your browser to the port shown in the output:
   ```
   üîç MCP Inspector is up and running at http://localhost:5173 üöÄ
   ```
7. Press the Connect button in the MCP Inspector interface
8. Open Activity Monitor and search for your executable name
9. Verify only the inspector and a single instance of your tool is running
10. In Xcode ‚Üí Debug ‚Üí Attach to Process ‚Üí Find your executable name at the top and attach
11. In Terminal, run `tail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log`
12. Now you can interact with your server through the inspector while hitting breakpoints in Xcode!

This setup provides a powerful debugging environment where you can:
- Test your MCP server's functionality through the Inspector's UI
- Set breakpoints in your code to trace execution
- Inspect variables and state during operation
- Debug resource, prompt, and tool implementations in real-time
