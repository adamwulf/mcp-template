# MCP Template

A template repository providing a barebones foundation for building Model Control Protocol (MCP) servers for macOS applications and command line tools.

## Overview

MCP Template serves as a starting point for developers looking to implement MCP servers in their projects. This template demonstrates how to use the `mcp-swift-sdk` in a minimal way, making it easier to understand the basics of MCP integration. It includes both a library template for integration into other projects and a simple command-line example to illustrate basic usage.

## Purpose

This repository is intended to be:
- A reference implementation showing how to use `mcp-swift-sdk`
- A template that can be forked or cloned as a foundation for your own MCP server implementations
- A barebones example that demonstrates core MCP concepts with minimal code

## Features

Current and planned features include:

- [x] Basic Swift package structure
- [x] Command line "hello world" example
- [ ] Command line stdio for direct MCP interaction
- [ ] Command line stdio ‚Üí standalone Mac app via Bonjour for networked MCP communication
- [ ] SSE server in a Package ‚Üí example command line app for SSE-based MCP

## Requirements

- Swift 6.0+
- macOS 15+
- iOS 17+ (for mobile integration)
- macCatalyst 17+ (for Catalyst apps)

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add the following to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/your-username/mcp-template.git", branch: "main"),
]
```

Then add the dependency to your target:

```swift
.target(
    name: "YourTarget",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "EasyMCP", package: "mcp-template")
    ]
),
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

```swift
import EasyMCP

// Create an instance of EasyMCP
let mcp = EasyMCP()

// Use MCP for AI interactions
let response = try await mcp.process("Hello, how can you help me today?")
print(response)
```

### Command Line Example

The package includes a command line executable called `mcpexample` that demonstrates basic usage:

```bash
# Run the example with a hello command
mcpexample hello
```

## Project Structure

### Targets

1. **EasyMCP** (Library)
   - Minimal template implementation of an MCP server
   - Demonstrates basic integration with the MCP protocol
   - Shows how to leverage the official `mcp-swift-sdk`

2. **mcpexample** (Executable)
   - Simple command-line example using the EasyMCP library
   - Demonstrates how to create a CLI-based MCP server
   - Uses `ArgumentParser` for CLI argument handling

3. **EasyMCPTests** (Test Target)
   - Template tests for the EasyMCP library functionality

### Dependencies

- [swift-argument-parser](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser) (1.3.0+) - Used for CLI argument handling
- [mcp-swift-sdk](https://github.com/loopwork-ai/mcp-swift-sdk) (main branch) - Core MCP implementation from loopwork-ai

## Development

To use this template for your own MCP server:

1. Clone or fork the repository
2. Build the package to verify everything works:
   ```bash
   swift build
   ```
3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   swift test
   ```
4. Modify the EasyMCP implementation to add your custom functionality
5. Extend the command line example or create your own Mac application

## Testing your MCP command line executable

To test and debug your MCP server using the MCP Inspector:

1. Build your command line executable in Xcode
2. Locate the executable by going to Xcode ‚Üí Product ‚Üí Show Build Folder in Finder
3. Copy the absolute path of the executable from that directory
4. Use the [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) to test your server
5. Open Terminal and run:
   ```bash
   npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector <absolute_path_to_your_executable>
   ```
6. Open your browser to the port shown in the output:
   ```
   üîç MCP Inspector is up and running at http://localhost:5173 üöÄ
   ```
7. Press the Connect button in the MCP Inspector interface
8. Open Activity Monitor and search for your executable name
9. Verify only the inspector and a single instance of your tool is running
10. In Xcode ‚Üí Debug ‚Üí Attach to Process ‚Üí Find your executable name at the top and attach
11. In Terminal, run `tail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log`
12. Now you can interact with your server through the inspector while hitting breakpoints in Xcode!

This setup provides a powerful debugging environment where you can:
- Test your MCP server's functionality through the Inspector's UI
- Set breakpoints in your code to trace execution
- Inspect variables and state during operation
- Debug resource, prompt, and tool implementations in real-time
